## Abstract ##

A modification to the dispensers mechanism to allow a standard dispenser to change
price automatically based on an external feed that acts as an oracle.

## Motivation ##

Usage of dispensers has opened up a lot of possibilities for dogeparty users,
letting the exchange of tokens for dogecoin flow more freely. However, the price
assigned to a dispenser is fixed to the given dogecoin amount when opening it,
making price swings problematic for dispenser offerings.

Oracled dispensers would allow pegging the value of a dispenser to a variable
feed multiplier, letting users specify the price of a given dispenser to a
multiplier of a feed.

## Rationale ##

Allowing users to fix a price to an external oracle would allow pegging token
offerings to "real world" assets, allowing sensible prices for long term things
like share selling, token packs and bundles. Usually pegging the value of a
token to a "real world" asset incurs contrived mechanisms like stablecoins or
rebasing of a coin supply. Having a way to easily fix the price of a dispenser
to an external ticker completely removes the need of these schemes that are
prone to manipulation and user confusion.

## Technical implementation ##

Two different parts need to be implemented.

 1) a mechanism to publish feeds that represent price pegging, with these feeds
 getting somehow paid by the users.
 2) a new type of dispenser opening where instead of a fixed dogecoin price, it
 refers to the feeds on point 1 and a multiplier of those feeds.

For this to work, a well known address publishes periodics updates to the feeds
via a broadcast. These updates can be done with a frequency at the sole
discretion of the feed operator.

Whenever an address creates or refills an oracle dispenser using a particular 
oracle, it needs to send, in the same transaction to create or refill the oracle
dispenser, a DOGE fee to that oracle address (due to the fact that operating an 
oracle costs transactions fees to the operators). This fee will be published in
the same broadcast used to publish the oracle price. 

Whenever a DOGE payment reaches a dispenser address, it gets compared to the
latest fee price multiplied by the dispenser amount (if the dispenser is oracled).
If there's a price match then the tokens get dispensed.

# API Changes

### create_dispenser

`create_dispenser` needs a new param, "oracle_address". When this param is not null,
then the dispenser will be considered an oracle dispenser that uses the price
published by the address equal to the param value. Also, when creating an oracle
dispenser, the mainchainrate will be interpreted as the oracle currency amount
needed to dispense the give_quantity. This amount will be derivated by dividing the
mainchainrate by 100, in other words, the two last digits will represent the
currency cents.

# Oracle feed broadcast specification

An oracle price feed will be a broadcast having:

* `text`: the short label representing the priced pair, having both currencies 
separated by a hyphen. Example: "DOGE-USD"
* `fee`: multiplier that will be used to calculate the fee needed to create an
oracle dispenser. Example: 0.00500000 represents a 0.5% of the total amount
of the dispenser
* `value`: the price of the DOGE in oracle currency. If this value is exactly zero
(0), then the oracle will be considered as stopped, then no oracle dispenser will be
created for this particular oracle, and any oracle dispenser using this oracle won't
dispense any token until this value is changed to positive

Any oracle dispenser transaction made on a specific block index will use the last
broadcast made by the oracle before that block index

# Database Changes

* `oracle_address` field will be added to dispensers table. 

# Consensus Changes

* All the above functionality

## Backwards Compatibility ##

The oracled dispensers will be a consensus change that will activate at a specific
block to be determined after implementation. All parsing servers will need to
upgrade before this block to maintain consensus.
