Dogeparty Improvement Proposals

This is the repository for Dogeparty Improvement Proposals, also known as "DIPs". People wishing to submit DIPs, first should propose their idea or document on the [Dogeparty forums](https://forums.dogeparty.net/c/development). After discussion and copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here, normally as a pull request merge.

The DIP process will follow the [Dogeparty Improvement Proposals (DIP) process](https://github.com/DogepartyXDP/dips/blob/master/dip-0001.md) as closely as is reasonably possible. We are fairly liberal with approving DIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a DIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a DIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Dogeparty users.
